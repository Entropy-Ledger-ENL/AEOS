# AI-Enhanced Operating System Interface (AEOS)

An experimental operating system interface that integrates large language models to enhance user interaction and system management. This project explores the potential of AI assistance in operating system operations while maintaining user control and system security.

## Key Features
- Natural language interface for system operations and file management
- AI-assisted task automation and workflow optimization
- Customizable interaction patterns and system behaviors
- Robust security controls and user oversight of AI operations
- Extensible architecture for supporting different language models

## Important Note
This is an experimental project that explores AI-OS integration while respecting technical limitations and security considerations. The AI assistant operates within carefully defined boundaries and user-specified permissions.
